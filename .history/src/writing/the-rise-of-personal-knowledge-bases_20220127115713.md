# The Rise of Personal Knowledge Bases

- more collaborative w/ API
- saving knowledge is easy (1st setp done) but getting it at the right time when we need them is not yet possible (2nd step)
- knowledge graph helps us see connections between topics and help us get new ideas
- tools are available (Pocket, MyMind, Notion, Obsidian, Roam Research, Monocle, #Content in my mind)
- useful for many people like you and me (teachers, content writers, librarians, design systems -> Chase McCoy)
  - My use case for conferences and Specify
    - also to brainstorm collectively it could be nice
  - Leslie's use case to associate visual concepts for her and her students
- grow your graph like you'd do with plants
